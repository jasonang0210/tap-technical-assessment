# We are the Champions

### How to run locally:

1. Ensure you have installed `docker` and `docker-compose` by installing the [DockerDesktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) application
2. Ensure that the Docker Desktop is running in the background.
3. Run `docker-compose build`
4. Run `docker-compose up`

Alternatively, you can check out the instance hosted on Azure by clicking [here](https://tap-frontend-hxa3g4emgqbsb6f0.southeastasia-01.azurewebsites.net/).

I am using Mac, I'm not sure if there'll be any issues with setting up locally on Windows, hopefully not.

Do reach out to me if there are any issues running it locally or if there are any issues with the hosted instance, thank you!
